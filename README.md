TianRuiXiang-Assistant
======================

This is a tiny application created to simplify the bussiness of TianRuiXiang. User can copy a list of data to it, use it to check the validity of data, and then make some transformation by user defined pattern.

We have two versions: one in Java and under Netbeans, the other is implemented by C-sharp. 
For the Java version, some tools are learned and used to generate a ".exe" Setup file from ".jar". ex. inno setup-5.5.1, jigloo_464, exe4j_windows_4_4_6, jsmooth-0.9.9-7-setup...
The C_sharp version needs .NET4.0 support to run.
